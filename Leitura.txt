Apresentação:
Good night, everyone. My name is Paulo, and today I introduce a website that I created for an online shoe store.
Its name is SCOMFORT.

Introdução:
The SCOMFORT Project is essentially an E-Commerce website for shoes. It was building using HTML, CSS, and Javascript,
all to make it high intuitive and easy accessible. In this apresentation, some of its functionalities will be described.

-------------------------------

Página Inicial: 


On the website's homepage, we have the brand logo "SCOMFORT," alongside a list of 4 items: "About Us," "Products," "Company,"
and "FAQ." Each of them leads to their respective sections on the page. On the right side, there is a shopping cart
where your purchases will be stored. This functionality becomes active after logging in, which is located right next
to the cart.
For the login, you can use an email and password combination to log into the site, enabling you to add items
to the shopping cart.

-------------------------------

Produtos:


After the website introduction, we will showcase some sneakers for sale. Just like on the login and registration screens,
the navigation is simple and intuitive. You will find four options of sneakers carefully selected to cater to your
style and preferences. Hovering over a sneaker image will enlarge it for easier product analysis. Below the image,
you will find the product name and its corresponding price.

About Company:

In the section titled "About Scomfort," we provide more information about our company, including why it was created,
the reason for establishing an online sneaker store, and various other details.
In the "Company" section, you'll find information about the location of Scomfort, highlighting
the qualities both inside and outside the company. The last topic emphasizes its interactivity, 
providing a brief expansion to enhance the fluidity of the page.

F.A.Q:


Following the insights into the "SCOMFORT" company, we have the section called FAQ - "Frequently Asked Questions."
Three questions have been selected, addressing some of the most commonly asked queries received by our support team.
This is designed to simplify and address any user doubts.
